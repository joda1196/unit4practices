## Description

You are making a practice blog site. You should have a couple pages. It should have a login page. You should have a page that shows all the blog posts. And you should have a page that allows you to add a blog post.

## First Page:

You should have a login page.

- [ ] It should take a username and password as a field.
- [ ] The password should show up as stars \*\*\*\*
- [ ] Both fields are required.
- [ ] There should be a login button that links to the next page.

** Extra Challenge** Actually implement the login page so that it does require a user to be created with a user creation screen and locks after three incorrect passwords

## Second Page:

You should have a page that shows all the blog posts made so far.

- [ ] Each blog post should show up with the username, the date, the blog title, and the blog post on top of one another.
- [ ] The username should show up in the top left of the screen.
- [ ] A create post button should link to the next page.

## Third Page:

You should have a page that is a form.

- [ ] You should have a title field that takes in the title.
- [ ] You should have a post field that takes 1000 characters for a blog post.
- [ ] You should have a field that takes the date, it should be not required and default to today.
- [ ] You should have a button that creates the post and takes you back to the main page. Which should update with the new post at the top.
