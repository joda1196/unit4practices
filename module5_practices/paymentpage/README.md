## Description:

You are making a couple pages connected to one another that will be the skeleton of an e-commerce page.

The first page should be taking in the values of how many each product you are purchasing, a cart button should lead to a second payment page that shows the cost and asks you to put in your payment details with a submit button, and the last page is a receipt page that says "Payment Received" and a list of your purchases with your total.

## First Page To Do:

You should have five products. You can choose any five products you want.

- [ ] Each product should have an image.
- [ ] Each product should have an input box beneath it to put how much of each product you are purchasing.
- [ ] Each product should have the price shown in front of the input box.
- [ ] You have a button that is labeled Cart. The cart button should link to the next page and also submit the values into your form.

## Second Page To Do:

You should have a page that provides your total and asks the following:

- [ ] First Name
- [ ] Last Name
- [ ] Address
- [ ] City
- [ ] State
- [ ] Zip Code
- [ ] Payment Method
- [ ] A submit button that submits the form and links to the next page.

## Third Page To Do:

You should have a payment confirmation page that provides your total and a receipt of your purchases.

- [ ] Your total
- [ ] Says Thank you, First Name Last Name, for your purchase!
- [ ] Has a link back to the first page (Home Page)
